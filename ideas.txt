Story:
    There's a light on in the window of a rickety motel. The light clicks off and a man walks out and down the motel steps to his car, then keys the ignition.
    The player then gets control of the car. He pulls out of the parking lot and drives down the road.
    The road is empty, no other drivers can be seen. The gas meter on the car is close to empty. Eventually, a gas station appears on the side of the road.
    The player pulls into the gas station parking lot in order to refuel. Player loses direct control of the car/character, automated park, and scene transition to inside the gas station.
    Player talks to the clerk of the station:

        Chap enters the chat.
        Texas enters the chat.

        Chap: "Got any gas?" (*raspily*)
        Texas: "Depends. How much are you willing to pay for it?"
        Chap: "All I got is 5 dollars."
        Texas: "Alright bet. Where ya headed?"
        Chap: "Somewhere far, far away from this goddamn town."
        Texas: "Cringe bro. Well you won't make it far if you're strapped for cash."
        Chap: "Fuck."
        Texas: "Tell ya what: I've got a lucrative proposition that might help ya out."
        Chap: "Bet. What's good?"
        Texas: "There's a cemetery up the road that some say hold untold riches. Here's a shovel and an obituary from 1947."
        Texas: "I've highlighted the names of the deceased known to come from wealthy families."
        Chap: "You're a fucking freak, bro. Give me some gas so I can get the fuck out of here."
        Texas: "Don't be such a negative Nancy. I will crush your skull between my thighs."
        Texas: "What'd you want?" --> Shop menu opens. Take shovel, list, and gas.
        Chap: "What's in it for you anyways?"
        Texas: "Well I'm gonna get my cut, of course."
        Chap: "Damn."

        Chap has left the chat.

    Player drives car down road, comes across cemetery, smashes the gate with his car and gets out. A popup appears, prompting the player to hit F to read the obituary list.
