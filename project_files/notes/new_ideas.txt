The terrain is one big island with trees, structures, and graves scattered about. Mobs will fight you during
the day as you loot structures and search for dungeons. Entering a grave sends you into the underworld where
you can fight your way through a dungeon to defeat a boss and steal their power. During the night, an
amalgamation of all the bosses you've killed launches an assault of mobs on you that you must defeat.
