2d dungeon crawler
Pitch black
You have flashlight and a gun but can only wield one at a time
If the flashlight illuminates a monster the hero turns it off in fear (trembling noise) for a cool down until he's no longer afraid
Maybe the story is you're locked out of your house and looking for the key


Walking around in a graveyard with ghosts
The map is not pitch black to the player but the hero can only see what's in front of him illuminated by his flashlight
He has a shovel and can dig up caskets and pull out the bodies to hide inside


Gravedigger in a cemetery
You have a list of names of rich people
Shine flashlight on tombstone to read the name
Dig up the casket, pull out the corpse, and take the gold
Ghost of deceased calls you a motherfucker and haunts you by taking control of the corpses you dig up
You have to beat the corpses with your shovel, they fall over into a pile of bones for a cool down
The ghost can then go take over another dug-up corpse
The corpses can continually be revived by the ghosts, they are never dead for good
You can hide in caskets that have been dug up

List of dead aristocrats (buried with gold)
List of dead mercenaries (buried with weapons)
You can only hold one item (shovel, gun) at a time and drop the other when you pick one up
Shovel kills in 3 hits, sword kills in 1
Shovel never breaks but sword breaks after number of strikes

You drive along the road from cemetery to cemetery
There are sometimes gas stations along the road where you can buy gas for your car, energy drinks that give you a dash, or bandaids that give you health
Rogue-like, see how far you can go, your score is the distance you've driven

You start out driving with a little bit of money
Your gas is running low
You have to pull into a gas station
You talk to the clerk, he asks you where you're headed and you say as far as you can go
You only have enough money to fill up your gas tank
He tells you he knows a way to make some quick money, hands you a shovel and a list of dead rich people

If you leave the cemetery the ghosts shut the gate on you and say Stay out! So you only have the one chance to collect as much money as you can before advancing

Start of the game (cutscene, no control), you flick off the light in your room at a motel, walk down the steps to your car, and key the ignition

Soundtrack when you're outside is uttica quarry, nighttime by slint and when you're in the gas stations it's Wngs by Knowledge
